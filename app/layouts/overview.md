Layout is the base class for all views that provide positioning of child elements.

You can use the various layout containers to position elements. They evaluate the base properties of view such as width, height, minWidth and alignments, and expose additional properties for positioning child views (such as the four paddings). Depending on the way they arrange the children, there are five types of layouts - AbsoluteLayout, DockLayout, GridLayout, StackLayout and WrapLayout.
